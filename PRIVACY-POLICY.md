# Privacy Policy for Abstract Name Service (ANS) Resolver Snap

_Last Updated: April 12, 2025_

## Introduction

The Abstract Name Service (ANS) Resolver Snap ("we", "our", or "Snap") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data when you use our MetaMask Snap.

## Information We Collect

The ANS Resolver Snap is designed with privacy in mind and collects minimal data:

- **Domain Names**: When you enter or interact with an .abs domain name, this information is processed to resolve it to an Ethereum address.
- **Transaction Data**: When you send a transaction to an .abs domain, we access the transaction details to provide resolution insights.

All data processing occurs locally within your browser and the MetaMask environment.

## How We Use Information

The information processed by the Snap is used solely for:

- Resolving .abs domain names to Ethereum addresses
- Displaying transaction insights for .abs domains
- Retrieving domain records when requested

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. All processing is done locally within your MetaMask environment. The only external communication is with the blockchain network to resolve domain names.

## Blockchain Interactions

To resolve domain names, our Snap interacts with:

- The Abstract blockchain network
- The Abstract Name Service smart contract

These interactions are read-only and do not modify blockchain state.

## User Rights

Since we do not collect or store your personal data, there is no data for you to access, delete, or modify outside of your local environment.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
